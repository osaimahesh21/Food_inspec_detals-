# üìò README ‚Äì Food Inspections Data Analysis

## üë®‚Äçüíª As a Data Engineer: First Steps

When receiving this dataset, a data engineer typically performs the following:

1. **Schema Validation**
   - Verify column names, data types, nullability, and primary identifiers.
   - Confirm expected formats (e.g., dates, ZIP codes, coordinates).

2. **Data Cleansing**
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Convert data types: parse date strings, clean text columns, cast numerics.
   - Normalize values (e.g., upper/lower casing for consistency).

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate summary statistics and value counts.
   - Identify outliers, anomalies, and null distributions.
   - Check value distributions across time, category, and location.

4. **Transformation & Enrichment**
   - Extract year/month from inspection dates.
   - Split multi-violation strings into structured records.
   - Generate flags or indicators (e.g., follow-up inspection, pass/fail binary).

5. **Create Analysis-Ready Dataset**
   - Drop irrelevant or duplicate columns.
   - Format and standardize columns (e.g., Zip as string, unified date format).
   - Save to clean format (e.g., Parquet/CSV).

6. **Document Assumptions & Decisions**
   - Note fields dropped or transformed.
   - Record assumptions about violation parsing, missing values, or inspection types.

## üîÑ Data Transformations (Recommended)

| Step | Transformation |
|------|----------------|
| ‚úÖ | Convert `Inspection Date` to datetime format |
| ‚úÖ | Parse and count violations from `Violations` text |
| ‚úÖ | Derive year, month, weekday from `Inspection Date` |
| ‚úÖ | Create a ‚ÄúFailure Flag‚Äù column from `Results` |
| ‚úÖ | Normalize facility names to lowercase/trim |
| ‚úÖ | Remove or handle null coordinates for mapping |
